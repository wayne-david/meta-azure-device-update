# The fstab (/etc/fstab) (or file systems table) file is a system configuration
# file on Debian systems. The fstab file typically lists all available disks and
# disk partitions, and indicates how they are to be initialized or otherwise
# integrated into the overall system's file system.
# See https://wiki.debian.org/fstab
